## Export to PDF

To export the slides to a PDF file. Make sure that you have `Playwright` installed first:

```shell
npm i -D playwright-chromium
```

Once you have done so, use the following syntax to export your slides from your root folder:


```shell
npx slidev export --executable-path "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --dark --format pdf --with-clicks --output slides
```
Note that you can change the format from `pdf` to `png` or `pptx` to output other formats.
`--executable-path` helps you specify the path to `chromium`, in my case, I identified it using `which chromium` syntax in my shell.
Note that `--executable-path` helps you make sure to render videos correctly in your export.
`--with-clicks` flag helps you to preserve animation by slide advancing.
`--dark` helps you choose the dark mode in the rendering of your slides.
Finally, `--output` flag helps you specify the name of the `pdf` file that you want to export to.

If you are interested in compressing the size of the PDF generated through above routine, please consider using the following syntax:

```shell
gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.5 -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -dPrinted=false -sOutputFile=slides_low_res.pdf slides.pdf
```

Note that you can switch to different compression sizes using `-dPDFSETTINGS` flag. For instance, you can use `\screen` for 72 dpi image resolution, or `\ebook` for 150 dpi.
